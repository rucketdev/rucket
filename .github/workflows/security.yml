          # - Transitive optional dependency from rust_decimal via byte-unit
          # - rkyv is in Cargo.lock but NOT compiled (rust_decimal only uses std feature)
          # - Verified via `cargo tree -e features | grep rkyv` returns empty
          # - False positive - can be removed when cargo-audit supports feature-aware scanning
