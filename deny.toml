# Advisory ignores - review quarterly and remove when upstream fixes are available

# RUSTSEC-2026-0001: rkyv OOM handling vulnerability (added 2026-01-06)
# - Transitive optional dependency from rust_decimal via byte-unit
# - rkyv is in Cargo.lock but NOT compiled (rust_decimal only uses std feature)
# - Verified via `cargo tree -e features | grep rkyv` returns empty
# - False positive - can be removed when cargo-audit supports feature-aware scanning
#
# RUSTSEC-2025-0134: rustls-pemfile unmaintained (added 2026-01-05)
# - Transitive dependency from axum-server
# - Blocked on: axum-server updating to use rustls-pki-types
#
# RUSTSEC-2024-0384: instant unmaintained (added 2026-01-05)
# - Transitive dependency from reed-solomon-erasure via parking_lot v0.11.2
# - Blocked on: reed-solomon-erasure updating parking_lot to newer version
